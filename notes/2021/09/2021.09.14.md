# CS Notes 9/14

## command-line arguments

`sys.argv` contains a list of command-line arguments. the first argument is almost always the name of the program/file.

## reading files

`open` is a built-in function that opens files.

```py
from sys import argv

with open(argv[1], 'r') as fp:
    entrails = fp.read()

print(entrails)
```

### opening multiple files

takes each argument from user and prints the file.

```py
from sys import argv

for item in argv[1:]:
    with open(item, 'r') as fp:
        entrails = fp.read()
    print(entrails)
```
