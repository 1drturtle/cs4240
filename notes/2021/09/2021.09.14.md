# CS Notes 9/14

## Command-line arguments

`sys.argv` contains a list of command-line arguments. the first argument is almost always the name of the program/file.

## Reading files

`open` is a built-in function that opens files.

```py
from sys import argv

with open(argv[1], 'r') as fp:
    entrails = fp.read()

print(entrails)
```

### opening multiple files

takes each argument from user and prints the file.

```py
from sys import argv

for item in argv[1:]:
    with open(item, 'r') as fp:
        entrails = fp.read()
    print(entrails)
```

## Copying a file

```py
from sys import argv


# first argument, copy to file (argv[1])
# second argument, file to copy to. (argv[2])

with open(argv[1], 'r') as fp:
    content = fp.read()

with open(argv[2], 'w+') as fp:
    fp.write(content)
```
