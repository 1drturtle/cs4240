# CS Notes 09/09

```py
c(n, k) - this is the number of subsets in sike k in a set of size n.

c(n, 0) = 1
c(n, 1) = n
c(n, n) = 1
...

Set has elements 1...n
k is an integer, 0 < k < n

How many subsets EXCLUDE 1?
c(n-1, k)

How many subsets INCLUDE 1?
c(n - 1, k - 1)

Conclusion
----------

c(n, k) = c(n - 1, k - 1) + c(n - 1, k)

Example
-------

c(4, 2) = c(3, 2) + c(3, 1)
        c(2,1) + c(2,2) + c(3, 1)
           2   +    1   +   3  = 6
