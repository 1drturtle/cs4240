# CS Notes 09/02

## Python Help

Calling `help` on anything will return the object's docstring

## Docstring

Triple-quoted string in a class or function that describes it's behavior

```py
>>> def square(x):
        """precondition: x is a number
    postcondition: returns the square of x"""
        return x ** 2

>>> print(help(square))
Help on function square in module __main__:

square(x)
    precondition: x is a number
    postcondition: returns the square of x

None
```

## Mutability

This function modifies the list `x` in place.

```py
def swap(x, j, k):
    """Swaps two items in list x.

    Args:
        x (list)
        j (int): indice of x
        k (int): indice of x

    Side effect: modifies input x
    Returns: None
    """
    x[j], x[k] = x[k], x[j]


x = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
swap(x, 0, 4)
print(x)
> ['e', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'a']
```

This is because lists are __mutable__, or able to change.
