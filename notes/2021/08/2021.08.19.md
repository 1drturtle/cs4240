Tally Marks
-----------

- Addition: put tallies together
- Subtraction: pair off smaller group of tallies to bigger group, whatever is left from bigger group is answer.
- Multiplication: For each tally mark in the first group, make a copy of the second, then glue them.
- Int division: Chop second operand out of first until you cannot anymore, keep number of chops as C. (C = A//B)
- Modulo: Same as division, but count the remaining after all groups have been chopped.

Not used because of interactions with complex numbers and the space requirements for large numbers. Hard to count large numbers.

Base Numbering Systems
======================

Known as denominational number systems, uses symbols to represent larger groups of numbers.

Roman Numerals
--------------

> MCMLVII = 1957

> CCXLIV + DLIX = DCCCV

Roman Numerals are **very** hard to do arithmetic with.

Dollar Total to Bills
---------------------

Go through each bill demarcation, and pull out the most amount you can, from largest to smallest.

```py
# bill demarcations
bills = [100,50,20,10,5,2,1]
# list of output bills
out = []
# user input
total = 237
# loop through each bill demarcation
for bill in bills:
    # while our current total is larger than the bill value
    while total >= bill:
        # take the bill value out of the total
        total -= bill
        # add a bill to the output list
        out.append(bill)

# display all bills as comma separated.
', '.join([f'${x}' for x in out])
```

Binary Numbers
--------------

Denominations for binary are powers of 2
> 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc
