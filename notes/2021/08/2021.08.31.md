# CS Notes 08/31

All code in python is a complete sentence that is instructing the computer to do something.

Programming has 3 features, Selection, Modularization, and Iteration. Languages without all 3 of these are not a full computer language (ex: HTML)

Boss Statements
---------------

Boss statements are blocks of statements that can change the flow of execution in a program.


[Code File](../../../testing/fun.py)


Standard Output (stdout)
---------------

Where the output of `print` goes. Initially from Unix, refers to the output of a program in the terminal.

Orphans
-------

Once an object is not referenced any more, it is "orphaned" and removed from the stack. Then, after an amount of time the garbage collector will reclaim the memory by removing it from the heap.

Local variables die when their function returns.

Functions
---------

Mathematical functions have 3 parts
- Domain
- Range/Co-domain
- Each element of the domain has a mapping to one element in the co-domain (range)

- `len` is a mathematical function.
    - Domain is any sequence
    - Co-domain is any non-negative integer
    - Each sequence has a defined length that is returned.
