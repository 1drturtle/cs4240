Strings
=======

Can be made with single or double quotes, but you need the same quote-type on both sides.
```py
>>> x = 'hello'
>>> y = "hello"
>>> x == y
True
```

Multi-line strings
------------------

Use triple-quotes
```py
>>> x = """this is a multi-
line string that can use
multiple lines."""
>>> x
'this is a multi-\nline string that can use\nmultiple lines.'
```

Raw String
----------

Ignores escape characters, prefixed with `r`
```py
>>> x = r'test\n'
>>> x
'test\\n'
```

String comparisons
------------------

String are compared by their ASCII value. For example, `'ab'` > `'aa'`

Order (in the string) goes numbers -> capital letters -> lowercase letters 

`ord()` returns the index value for a character in the unix alphabet.

> a.k.a lexicographical order

Format Strings
--------------

```py
>>> f'{3+7} == {100-90}'
'10 == 10'
```
