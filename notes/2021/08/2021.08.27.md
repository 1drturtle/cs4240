Truthy/Falsy
------------

Truthy things
```py
1
['not', 'empty', 'list']
'string with words'
```

False-y things
```py
0
[]
''
{}
tuple()
None
```

Symbol Table
------------

Every time you create a variable, you are writing on the symbol table. The symbol table contains a mapping (dictionary) of variable names to memory addresses containing their values.

```py
>>> x = 4
>>> dir()  # default python values removed for ease of reading.
[..., 'x']
```

Without any functions, you can only see the global scope.
