Command Windows
---------------

|Platform|Type|
|--------|----|
|Windows|CMD/Powershell|
|Mac|Terminal (Unix)|
|Linux|Bash Shell|

> Tutorials on Morrison's Command Window page for more information.

Typing `py` into the terminal opens the Python Interactive Shell (REPL)

__REPL:__

R - Read

E - Evaluate

P - Print

L - Loop


Into the Python Shell
=====================


Whole Number Arithmetic
-----------------------

Math can be done in the REPL shell

```py
>>> 2 + 2
4
>>> 2 - 2
0
>>> 2 * 2
4
>>> 10 / 3
3.333333333333
>>> 10 // 3
3
>>> 10 % 3
1
>>> 2 ** 5
32
>>> type(2)
<class 'int'>
```

In Python, there are no limits on the size of integers.

> What is this? Covered in Future lesson
> ```py
>>> 3^4
>7
>```

Floating Point Numbers
----------------------

Floats are numbers that contain decimals.

IEEE double precision floating point numbers (known as 'doubles' in other languages).

Floating point numbers are stored **approximately**.

```py
>>> type(3.333333333333)
<class 'float'>
```

Adding an integer and a float results in a float
```py
>>> 4 + 0.5
4.5
```

Engineering Format
-----------

Numbers can be used in engineering format

```py
>>> 4e5
40000.0
```

Casting
-------

When you force an object to temporarily become a specific type.
```py
>>> int(4.5)
4
>>> int(-4.5)
-4
```

Casting a float to an int results in truncation of the decimal value.

Can also convert int -> float
```py
>>> float(4)
4.0
```

Complex Numbers
---------------

```py
>>> z = complex(3, 4)
>>> z
(3+4j)
>>> z ** 2
(-7+24j)
```

Variables
=========

Variable Names
--------------
__Rules:__
1. Must start with an alphabetical character (`a-z`) or an underscore (`_`).
2. Succeeding characters are alphanumerical (`a-z` and `0-9`) and underscore (`_`).

Examples of Valid Variable Names:
1. `abc_123`
2. `testing_testing`
3. `a1111`
4. `UpperCaseLowercase`

Examples of Invalid Variable Names:
1. `1abc`
2. `|432c`
3. `-ewad`

Snake Notation
--------------

Notation of writing variables, all lowercase and replace spaces with underscores. Normal format but not required.

Types & Variables
-----------------

> Variables **do not** have types. 

They contain data that has a type, but are not forced to contain a certain type.

Variables **refer** or **point to** to objects, and the objects have types (`int`, `str`, etc)

Python and Memory
-----------------

Two important types of memory:

__Stack__ - Where the variables live. High priced memory and **fixed** in size.

__HEAP__ - Warehouse of memory, where all objects live. Plentiful store in memory, can be expanded up to system limit.

Variables store **memory addresses** (a.k.a pointer, an 8-bit integer) that leads to an object on the HEAP.

> The function when not in any functions is referred to as the __global scope__.

Strings
-------

Strings store globs of text.

Strings are immutable, but variables can be pointed at new strings.

```py
>>> z = 'abcdefg'
>>> z
'abcdefg'
```

A string knows its character sequence, and can retrieve them using slicing with indices. Negative indices start from the end of the list and count backwards (start at `-1` vs `-0`)

```py
>>> x = 'abcdef'
>>> x[0]
'a'
>>> x[1]
'b'
>>> x[-1]
'f'
```

There is no `character` type, there is only strings.

You can also slice a string. For a slice, the first number is inclusive while the second number is exclusive. `[1:4]` returns index 1, 2 and 3 but not 4.

```py
x[start:end:skip]
```

```py
>>> x = 'abcdefghijkl'
>>> x[1:4]
'bcd'
>>> x[1:]
'bcdefghijkl
>>> x[::2]
'acegik'
>>> x[::-1]
'lkjihgfedcba
```

Strings are concatenated with the addition operator `+`
```py
>>> 'abc' + 'def'
'abcdef'
```

String Functions
----------------

All objects have methods. Strings have some helpers methods.

```py
>>> 'abc'.upper()
'ABC'
>>> 'ABC'.lower()
'abc'
```

Relational Operators and Booleans
---------------------------------

Relational operators compares two things and returns True or False.

```py
>>> type(True)
<class 'bool'>
```

Inequalities like greater than or less than.

|Operators|Operation|
|---------|---------|
|>|Greater Than|
|<|Less Than|
|>=|Greater than or equal to|
|<=|Less than or equal to|
|==|Equal to|
|!=|Not equal to|

```py
>>> 4 < 5
True
>>> 5 < 4
False
>>> 4 <= 5
True
>>> 4 >= 5
False
>>> 4 != 5
True
```

Equality operator is two `==`. Do not use `=` for comparison.
```py
>>> 4 == 5
False
```

> Variables must always be on the left hand side of the assignment.

And and Or
----------

`and` ensures both conditions are `True`, while `or` checks if __either__ conditions are True

```py
>>> True or False
True
>>> True and False
False
>>> False and False
False
>>> False or False
False
```

> Future Homework, prove Python boolean order of operations.

Type Determines Context
-----------------------
An objects type determines how it will interact with operators.
Integers are summed when added, while strings are concatenated. You cannot perform arithmetic between two different objects.

```py
>>> 1 + 3
4
>>> 'abc' + 'def'
'abcdef'
>>> 'abc' + 3
TypeError: can only concatenate str (not "int") to str
>>> 'abc' + str(3)
'abc3'
>>> a = 'cows'
>>> b = 42
>>> f'{a}{b}'
'cows42'
```

Format Strings
--------------

Prefix a string with `f` to allow expressions to be parsed in strings and casted to string, placed in the string.

```py
>>> f'{42+3}'
'45'
```
