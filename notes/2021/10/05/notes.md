# CS Notes 10/5

## Java Compiler

- Program is first compiled into JVM machine code before able to be executed.
- Compile-time errors will pop up at compile time.

## Java Types

- All Primitive types
  - Integers can be max four bytes.
  - Float: 32 bit single precision number. (rarely used)
  - Double: 64 bit double precision number. (more commonly used)
  - Byte: 8 bits
  - Short: 4 bytes
  - Long: Very big integer
  - BigInteger: unlimited size integer, but uses more memory
  - Primitive types store their values directly
- Object called Math, built in to scope and has math functions
- Strings: Similar to Python
- ArrayList: List, very different
- Capital letter on type signifies Primitive.

## Java For-Loop

- for (initializer; test; between)
- initializer is run once, then the test is run for every iteration
